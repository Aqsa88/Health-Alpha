People usually want to know how to reach the other people involved in the project. Setting up a communication channel for your project where people can discuss things with each other and new developers can reach you easily is very useful. We created a group for our project in Google Groups. A Google Group is like a mailing list because it contains the email addresses of its members. Google Groups is a feature of Google Apps that makes it easy to communicate and collaborate with project team members. Using Google Groups we can hold discussions with each other over the web or email.
