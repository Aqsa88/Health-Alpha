# Documentation
However, we write the documentation to let the people read about our project as well as we are new in open source project so our documentation is not that much as it is supposed to be. we will write some instructions for using a system, Electronic health records or EHR software is utilized by clinics and hospitals alike and is typically merged with hospital management software. AS well in this documentation, we mean that we are going to avoid some of what we did even if we are not complete, but it will give an overview of what we did as well as a hint about what the expert does and what is the things that will be accepted.
