#'<Documentation>'
However, we write the documentation to let the people read about the expected things as well as we are new in open source project so our documentation is not complete so it will be updated. The most important document for initial users is the basics we mean that we are going to avoid some of what we did even if we are not complete but it is to give an overview of what we did also it is to give a hint about what the expert does and what is the things that it will be accepted.
