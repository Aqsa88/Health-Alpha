Reasons for choosing github over other tools are following: 

* Large Developer Community: GitHub has a massive developer community of over 56 million users, making it a great platform for open source projects. Developers can easily collaborate and contribute to projects, and project owners can leverage this community to get feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.

* Integration with other tools: GitHub integrates with a wide range of tools, including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) services like Travis CI and CircleCI, code review tools like Codacy and Code Climate, and communication tools like Slack and Trello. This allows developers to streamline their workflows and focus on writing code.

* Ease of use: GitHub is relatively easy to use and has a simple user interface that makes it easy to manage repositories, collaborate with others, and track issues. This is especially important for open source projects, which often have a large number of contributors who may not be familiar with the project's codebase.

* Security and Reliability: GitHub has a high level of security and reliability. It uses HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit and stores all data on servers in multiple data centers around the world. Additionally, GitHub has a team of dedicated security professionals who constantly monitor the platform for vulnerabilities and respond to any security incidents.

* Community-driven development: GitHub enables a community-driven approach to development, where anyone can contribute to a project, whether it's through reporting issues, submitting code changes, or suggesting new features. This fosters a sense of ownership and engagement among contributors, leading to more robust and innovative projects.
