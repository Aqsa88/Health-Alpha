# Health-Alpha  <br>

This is an open source project for a system that intends to consolidate the nation's healthcare system into a single, functional framework while giving the staff 
members advantages like much-needed shared data. Additionally, to allow all users to benefit from the various services provided by various medical facilities, 
for example, a patient being able to schedule an appointment online with the doctor of his choice, saving him the trouble of physically traveling to the hospital and 
enduring long wait times.
