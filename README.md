 # ITSE 476 - Phase 1

# Health-Alpha  <br>

This is an open source project for a system that intends to consolidate the nation's healthcare system into a single, functional framework while giving the staff members advantages like much-needed shared data. Additionally, to allow all users to benefit from the various services provided by various medical facilities, for example, a patient being able to schedule an appointment online with the doctor of his choice, saving him the trouble of physically traveling to the hospital and enduring long wait times.

# Look around First
There are different projects similar to our site But we will definitely work on more and new features as we mintiend in our mission that were not available on such sites, and this is what will make us the best.
# Start from what you have:
Hospital Management System is going to be turned into a free and open source system. Based on the contributors of then Hospital Management system. Which is a system developed for ITSE 305 course that is Software Engineering Project. The system has been partially developed and it is now time to provide a platform to our system "open source software", and give the exact license. The system's improvements will focus on management of hospital, appointement registration, management of appointements, and payment . By optimizing inventory management, notification, and scheduling of appointements, the new system will be focused on enhancing customer service .
# Good Name
For Our Hospital management system we have used the name Health Alpha which is unique and at the same time easy to remember
# Project is free and open source:
To avoid confusions and limitations it is very impoertant to state the project is free and Open source This makes the project Powerful and simple to use Our project is an open sopurce nad free to use project It uses GNU liscense this system is free open-source software. Participation is open to everybody. in Addition to that there are some limitations to our project that include:
1- The system will be developed using c++.
2- The system will be multilanguage .
3- The systemm will be accessed by different users .i.e Staff, Patients,Doctors, Nurse


# Features and Requirement List <br>

Some of the main **features** for Health-Alpha are: <br>
* Allows user to register an account and login through CPR.
* Allows user to check his/her profile info and make changes.
* Allows user to select health care centers of choice.
* Allows user to register appointments, edit, approve and cancel appointments.
* Allows user to make a secured and safe payment through system.

Some of the main **requirements** for Health-Alpha are: <br>
* To establish and overall working base system structure.
* Must run on multiple platforms and devices.
* Must adapt to changes made to system without comprimising surrounding components.

# Development Status <br>

* The system has completed the final stages of its initial functionality and basic design.
* The project is still in progress, though. Developers and other participants who are ready to work with us will try to implement the complete project.
* Every implemented function will be made available in the repository up to the project's conclusion.

# Download <br>

* Since this project is an open source one the repository is free to use and downloadable.
* Download this project as a Zip file or clone it.
* Transfer this project to the main directory.
* Open the project in your browser now. It should work fine.

# Documentation <br>
However, we write the documentation to let the people read about our project as well as we are new in open source project so our documentation is not that much as it is supposed to be. we will write some instructions for using a system, Electronic health records or EHR software is utilized by clinics and hospitals alike and is typically merged with hospital management software. AS well in this documentation, we mean that we are going to avoid some of what we did even if we are not complete, but it will give an overview of what we did as well as a hint about what the expert does and what is the things that will be accepted. 

# Developer Documentation <br>
Anyone without programming skills cannot write it; it is always created by the developer. It serves to teach other programmers how to deal with code, making it more social than technical. You can find the developer documentation in the design document, and everything will be sorted and organized using wikis.  


# Communication channel <br>
People usually want to know how to reach the other people involved in the project. Setting up a communication channel for your project where people can discuss things with each other and new developers can reach you easily is very useful. We created a group for our project in Google Groups. A Google Group is like a mailing list because it contains the email addresses of its members. Google Groups is a feature of Google Apps that makes it easy to communicate and collaborate with project team members. Using Google Groups we can hold discussions with each other over the web or email.

# Version control and Bug / Issue Tracker Access
## Version control
Version Control means track all the changes of your project. Having a github repository make it easier for us to keep track of everything. Each file on GitHub has a history which make it easy for us to explore the changes that have occurred to it at different times and by other members. We can review other's code, add comments, and suggest changes. <br>
In github we create a main repository and everything associated to our project is kept here. Where every group member can create files, commit changes and review other work. 
<br>
## Bug / Issue Tracker
On our github repository page, we have an "Issues" tab in the top menu. Here anyone from the project member can open an issue, can give it a title, add comments, report bug, attach files and visual proofs and can also give it a label. Project memebers can Vote on issues that they want to see tackled. We can Close issues from commit messages.
