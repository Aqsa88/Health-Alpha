## Version control
Version Control means track all the changes of your project. Having a github repository make it easier for us to keep track of everything. Each file on GitHub has a history which make it easy for us to explore the changes that have occurred to it at different times and by other members. We can review other's code, add comments, and suggest changes. <br>
In github we create a main repository and everything associated to our project is kept here. Where every group member can create files, commit changes and review other work.

## Bug / Issue Tracker
On our github repository page, we have an "Issues" tab in the top menu.
